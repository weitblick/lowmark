### – A Low-tech Markdown Website Generator

Create websites with ease – using just Markdown.

- Write and publish your content as simple Markdown files
- This “CMS” is technically just a small PHP script
- No technical skills required – installation and usage take just a few minutes
- The core innovation is its radical simplicity, putting content back at the center
- Inspired by the ideals of the [Lowtech](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/), [Slow Media](https://www.slow-media.net/manifest) and [Small Web](https://smallweb.page/home) movements

Our goal is to create a lightweight online space where documents are simply documents — respecting the privacy, attention, and cognitive capacity of every reader, and promoting both mental and ecological sustainability.

> **Lowmark** isn’t about tech – it’s about values.
